# [Gloop][]

Gloop provides SDL2 game loops.

Gloop is a thin wrapper around [the sdl2 package][]. It provides a single
function called `play` that handles a game loop with a fixed update time step
and variable rendering as described by Robert Nystrom's [Game Programming
Patterns][]. Its interface is modeled after [the gloss package][].

To get started, check out [the example][].
